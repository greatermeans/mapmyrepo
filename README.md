# MapMyRepo

MapMyRepo is a project completed by students in the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) June 2016 Web Immersive Course. 

MMR is a single page JavaScript application that lets a user
  1) see an index of GitHub repositories that a given GitHub user has contributed to
  2) select a repo from the index and see all of its contributors displayed on a global Google Map; each user's location (if they have one) is pulled from her GitHub user profile.
The user can click on a marker at a location to see the username and avatar of the user from that location, and then redirect to her GitHub profile. 

MMR uses Ajax to access GitHub's API to get repo and user data and the Google Map and Geocoding APIs to create the map
