Great job!
Suggestions:
+ Possible duplicate `event.preventDefault()` gatherContributors in app.js
+ Suggest creating a contributor controller and separating some of the contributor logic in app.js to that new controller
+ Suggest refactoring `displayReponsitories()` so it's more DRY.
+ App flow is a little unclear (where it starts, what happens next)
+ Constructors look good. Nice file organization overall
